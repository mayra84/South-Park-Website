        basicSummary: 'Eric Theodore Cartman, usually referred to as just Cartman, is one of the main characters, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick. Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an episode, for example "Trapper Keeper". None of the other three main children really consider Cartman their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, but a certain form of unstable friendship ends up being born between them. However he is usually Kyle\'s first choice when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend, however, in later seasons, Butters Stotch is usually depicted as such. \nCartman was the first one of the boys to be shown without his hat, as seen in "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!". He also weighs 90 pounds, as revealed in "Weight Gain 4000".'

        image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/KennyMcCormick.png",
        basicSummary: 'Kenneth "Kenny" McCormick,[6][7] voiced by Matt Stone, is one of South Park\'s main characters, along with Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, and Kyle Broflovski. He first appears in the short films both entitled The Spirit of Christmas in 1992 and 1995. He is voiced by Mike Judge in the feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and Eric Stough in "The Jeffersons", "Lice Capades", "Mysterion Rises", and "Turd Burglars". \nKenny is most famous for dying in almost every episode in the first five seasons of South Park. He is also easily recognizable for almost always wearing an orange parka, or just having his face hidden, that covers most of his face and muffles his speech. In "Mysterion Rises" Kenny, who is revealed to be the superhero Mysterion, reveals that he has the power of immortality, in a sense, and that he just wakes up in his bed after having died. He is then upset that his friends never remember him dying, and even kills himself in front of everyone to prove himself. \nThe character was killed off the show in the Season Five episode, "Kenny Dies", but returned in the following season, at the end of "Red Sleigh Down" and has since been a regular character; however, he now only dies occasionally. In most of the episodes in the tenth and eleventh seasons, he tends to recede into the background, though this tendency seems to have ended with the Season Eleven finale. Throughout the tenth, twelfth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-third seasons, Kenny did not die once. Kenny died three times in total in Season Thirteen, five times in Season Fourteen, and once in seasons fifteen, sixteen, twenty-one and twenty-two.'

    //     basicSummary: 'Leopold "Butters" Stotch is a major character in the series. He is a fourth-grader in South Park Elementary. Butters\' role gradually began to increase after he replaced Kenny during his temporary removal in Season Six. This allowed Butters to gain more screen time and further develop his character. He is the "innocent child" in the group and Cartman\'s most exploited and possibly best "friend". Butters is loosely based on Eric Stough, an animation director/producer that works on the show.'
